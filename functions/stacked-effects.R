#' Estimating Stacked Marginal Effects and Contrasts for Bayesian Models
#' 
#' This function facilitates the estimation of stacked averaged marginal 
#' effects for Bayesian models and is designed to account for uncertainty in 
#' the process of model selection when estimating average effects and adjusted 
#' probabilities.

#' @param x A list object returned by `brmsmargins::brmsmargins`. The object
#' must contain at a minimum two matrices, one called the `Posterior` and the 
#' other called `Contrasts`. See ?brmsmargins::brmsmargins for additional 
#' details.
#'
#' @param weights A vector of stacking weights such as that returned by the
#' `stacking_weights` function. `weights` must be the same length as `x`.
#' 
#' @param seed An integer value to use for the random number seed to ensure the 
#' index values for the random draws are locally reproducible.
#
#' @param ... Additional arguments for future development, currently unused.
#'
#' @return A tibble containing the stacked posterior draws for the average
#' marginal effects
