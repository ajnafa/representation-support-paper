# From Seeing to Believing? How Female Representation Shapes Support for Democracy

### [A. Jordan Nafa](https://www.ajordannafa.com/) • University of North Texas

### Abstract

> While scholars have long recognized the role of descriptive
> representation and the *politics of presence* in shaping individuals’
> attitudes towards social and political institutions, few studies have
> examined the impact of descriptive representation on citizens’ support
> for democracy as a system of government and their willingness to
> reject non-democratic alternatives. Drawing on theories of political
> socialization, institutional learning, and political backlash, this
> article examines the degree to which symbolic female representation in
> government shapes the attitudinal dimension of democratic
> consolidation. Leveraging five waves of the Integrated Values Survey
> across sixty-three countries between 1995 and 2020, I estimate a
> series of societal growth curve models and employ Bayesian Model
> Averaging to adjudicate between competing theoretical explanations.
